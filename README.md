##  Executive Summary
This project examines the **Mexico Toy Sales** dataset‚Äîa fictional but realistic simulation of daily sales, inventory, product, and store-level data for a Mexican toy store chain, Maven Toys, spanning 2022‚Äì2023. Our goal is to surface strategic insights into:

- **Operational efficiency**: Inventory turnover rates and cash flow implications.
